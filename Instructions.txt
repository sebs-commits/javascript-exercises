Now that you have cloned the repository and run npm install to install Jest, complete these exercises in the following order:

    - helloWorld (This exercise is intentionally very simple to ensure that you have set up everything properly!)
    - repeatString
    - reverseString
    - removeFromArray
    - sumAll
    - leapYears
    - tempConversion

Once you have a working solution, see how it compares to the exercise’s given solution. Solutions for the exercises can be found in the ‘solution’ folder of each exercise.
